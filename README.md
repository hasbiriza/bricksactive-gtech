## üß© Overview

This project is a technical test for migrating the **BricksActive homepage** into a fully functional, responsive, and high-performance **Shopify theme** using **Liquid**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**.

The goal is to replicate a custom homepage layout while ensuring:
- Design fidelity
- Mobile responsiveness
- Interactive features (sliders, testimonials)
- Shopify compatibility
- Speed and usability

##  Development Approach

Shopify offers two approaches to frontend development:

1. **Headless** using frameworks like Next.js or Remix via Storefront API.
2. **Native Liquid Theme** ‚Äì Shopify‚Äôs default approach, recommended for most use cases and fully compatible with Online Store 2.0.

For this project, I chose the second approach, building directly with **Shopify Liquid** and enhancing the theme using JavaScript (SwiperJS) and CSS utilities.

##  Theme Foundation

When a new Shopify store is created, Shopify automatically installs a default theme. As of this writing, the default theme is **Dawn** ‚Äî a flexible, fast, and extensible base theme.

While Dawn already provides a solid structure, I extended it with **custom sections** to meet the design and functional requirements of BricksActive.

## üìÅ Shopify Theme Structure

Shopify themes follow a well-defined structure with six main directories:

- `/assets` ‚Äì CSS, JS, fonts, icons, images
- `/layout` ‚Äì Base templates like `theme.liquid`
- `/templates` ‚Äì Page templates (e.g. `index.json`, `product.json`)
- `/sections` ‚Äì Modular UI components used in templates
- `/snippets` ‚Äì Reusable components (buttons, cards, etc.)
- `/locales` ‚Äì Translation files for multi-language support

Understanding and following this structure ensures scalable and maintainable theme development.

## üöÄ Live Demo

You can view the working demo at:

**üîó https://bricksactive-gtech.myshopify.com**  
**üîí Password:** `live`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Shopify does not allow theme duplication or local development from a non-collaborator account. All development was done directly on this test store, and the demo link is the only way to preview the result.

---

## ‚ú® Custom Section Overview

All custom sections are stored in the `/sections` folder and use the naming pattern:
custom-[feature].liquid





## üåÄ Sliders with SwiperJS

All carousel and slider functionality is powered by **SwiperJS**, ensuring:
- Smooth mobile swipe experience
- Autoplay + manual navigation
- Lightweight and fully responsive

---

## üì¶ Metafield Integration: Testimonials

The testimonial section uses **Shopify Metaobjects**, allowing each testimonial to be managed dynamically via the Shopify Admin.

Each testimonial includes:
- Avatar image
- Star rating (1‚Äì5 stars)
- Customer quote

This makes the section fully CMS-driven and editable by non-developers.

---

## üõí Bonus: Full Storefront Usability

Although the test focuses on the homepage, I extended the functionality to support a **complete shopping flow**.

You can simulate checkout using Shopify‚Äôs built-in test mode:

1. Go to any product ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout  
2. Use any dummy card:
   - Card Number: `1`
   - CVV: `123`
   - Name: Any name

This demonstrates that the theme is not only visually accurate but also fully functional.
